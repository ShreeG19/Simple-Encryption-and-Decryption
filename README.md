#  Simple Encryption and Decryption

A basic project that demonstrates simple encryption and decryption logic for educational purposes. Ideal for beginners learning how data can be secured using basic algorithms.

##  Features

- Encrypts plaintext using a basic algorithm (e.g., Caesar cipher or XOR)
- Decrypts ciphertext back to original message
- Easy to understand and modify
- Lightweight and fast

##  Tech Used

- Arduino / Python (based on your version)
- Logic based on substitution or bitwise operations

##  How It Works

1. User inputs a message and key.
2. Message is encrypted using a lightweight algorithm.
3. Encrypted message can be decrypted with the same key.


##  Educational Use

- Demonstrates basic data security concepts
- Useful in IoT, microcontroller, and beginner crypto learning
- Can be extended into stronger encryption methods
